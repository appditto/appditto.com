Except to the extent otherwise required by conflicting non-U.S. privacy laws, such information will be protected by United States laws, which may not be as protective as the laws in your country. The United States, European Economic Area Member States, and other countries all have different laws. When your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your personal information in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those in the country in which you live. For example, the circumstances in which law enforcement can access personal information may vary from country to country. In particular, if your information is in the United States, it may be accessed by government authorities in accordance with the laws of the United States and its states.</p><h2 id=\"automatic-information-collection\"><strong>Automatic Information Collection</strong></h2><p>When you download, access or use the App, we may automatically collect the following types of information about you and your use of the App:</p><p>● <strong><strong>Device Information.</strong></strong> We may collect and otherwise process information about your mobile device and internet connection on which and through which you use the App, including the device’s unique device identifier, IP address, operating system, browser type, and mobile network information.

Your Wallet Seed is stored on your device and is never sent to us. Therefore, you are solely responsible for the security and safeguarding your Wallet Seed. We do not record, store or have access to your Wallet Seed and we cannot recover it for you if you lose it.</p><p>● Any Nano currency that you choose to hold, store, manage, receive, send or transmit using the App, and any balance or transaction information relating to it, are never held, stored, known, managed, received, sent or transmitted by Appditto LLC.
