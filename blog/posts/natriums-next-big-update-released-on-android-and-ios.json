Natrium is <em><em>fast </em></em>and it’s full of features: Paper wallet / seed sweeping, push notifications, multiple accounts, contacts, numerous currency conversions and translations, and more.</p><h2 id=\"representatives-decentralization\">Representatives &amp; Decentralization</h2><p>Decentralization is a key component to making NANO network stronger. Because of this, we started focusing on the things that can speed up this process and make it easier. Today we have the first result of our efforts: We are adding a pre-populated list of representatives that have a relatively small voting-weight — provided by <a href=\"https://mynano.ninja/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">My Nano Ninja</a>. This makes choosing a quality representative incredibly easy — just tap “Pick From a List” button and pick a representative, no need to go search for a representative and copy paste the address. But if you want to do that, you still can with the “Manual Entry” button.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"image-wrapper\"><img datasizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_1200,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-representative-list.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_100,c_limit,q_1,f_auto,pg_1/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-representative-list.png\" data-srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_300,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-representative-list.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_600,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-representative-list.png 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_900,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-representative-list.png 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_1200,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-representative-list.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_1500,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-representative-list.png 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_2000,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-representative-list.png 2000w\" class=\"kg-image lazyload\" alt=\"Easy to use Representative List\"></div><figcaption>Easy to use Representative List</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"nano-prefix\">Nano Prefix</h2><p>Existing Android users using Natrium are already familiar with this. Their address begins with <code>nano_</code> instead of <code>xrb_</code>. For iOS users, we reverted to using <code>xrb_</code> due to lack of support with some other services in the Nano ecosystem. However, with the news about the upcoming <a href=\"https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/1771\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nano V19 emitting </a><code><a href=\"https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/pull/1771\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">nano_</a></code> prefixes — Natrium is now using <code>nano_</code> everywhere. You can still send to either type of prefix, but throughout the app addresses will be represented with <code>nano_</code>. For some parts such as account history, it will still display with <code>xrb_</code> until we upgrade our node to V19. After that, app-wide everything will be using the new prefix.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"image-wrapper\"><img datasizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_1200,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-nano-prefix.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_100,c_limit,q_1,f_auto,pg_1/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-nano-prefix.png\" data-srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_300,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-nano-prefix.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_600,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-nano-prefix.png 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_900,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-nano-prefix.png 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_1200,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-nano-prefix.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_1500,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-nano-prefix.png 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_2000,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-nano-prefix.png 2000w\" class=\"kg-image lazyload\" alt=\"nano_ prefix\"></div><figcaption>nano_ prefix</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"more-than-a-wallet\">More Than a Wallet</h2><p>As you may now, we have been focused strictly on creating a solid wallet for Nano that everyone would enjoy using everyday, from the most avid Nano enthusiast to someone that just met with Nano.</p><p>Today, we are proud to announce that we are rebranding. Instead of “Natrium Wallet”, the new preferred name is simply “Natrium”. We‘re working on other Nano-related products, many of which will be a vital part of the Natrium app. All these developments will be a part of the Natrium brand — interested in what we’re doing?
