Flutter applications are developed using the <a href=\"https://dartlang.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dart</a> programming language.</p><p>The first technological hurdle was to develop an offline-signing library that would allow the app to sign and create operations completely on the device itself, this results in <strong><strong>private keys never being sent to the server</strong></strong>. The library we developed is called <a href=\"https://github.com/appditto/pascaldart\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">pascaldart</a> — it implements signing, encryption including ecies encryption for payloads, JSON-RPC, and more. It is available publicly <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/pascaldart\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">here</a> and is also on <a href=\"https://github.com/appditto/pascaldart\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Github</a>.</p><p>Another major consideration when dealing with private-key security is storage of the private key. The private key needs to be stored securely on the user’s device — we use the native <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Android KeyStore</a>, and the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">iOS KeyChain</a> for secure key storage.</p><p>For the application state we are using <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/mobx\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">mobx</a>. This is a reactive state management system that efficiently maintains the entire state of the application and all of the user’s accounts.</p><h2 id=\"user-interface-experience\">User Interface &amp; Experience</h2><p><a href=\"http://pascalcoin.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Pascal</a> has a feature rich protocol with a lot of different capabilities. We tried to highlight these features without overwhelming new users. We created a simple &amp; friendly interface that can suit both new users and enthusiasts alike. We made various custom animations and illustrations to create an easily understandable and enjoyable experience for everyone.</p><p>We also developed various different features that would make operation of the wallet faster while feeling familiar to users with different levels of knowledge about the Pascal protocol, such as the contacts feature.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"image-wrapper\"><img data-sizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_1200,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/Contacts.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_100,c_limit,q_1,f_auto,pg_1/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/Contacts.png\" data-srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_300,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/Contacts.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_600,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/Contacts.png 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_900,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/Contacts.png 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_1200,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/Contacts.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_1500,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/Contacts.png 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_2000,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/Contacts.png 2000w\" class=\"kg-image lazyload\" alt=\"With contacts, sending &amp; receiving Pascal is easier and more secure\"></div><figcaption>With contacts, sending &amp; receiving Pascal is easier and more secure</figcaption></figure><p>At Appditto we pride ourselves on using the latest, most innovative technologies in order to provide not only the best product possible — but also the best user experience.
