Natrium 1.0 was originally released in November on Android and the reaction to the release was overwhelmingly positive. Since then, we’ve been investing hundreds of hours on the next generation of Natrium.</p><p>Natrium 2.0 was rewritten from the ground up using <a href=\"https://flutter.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Flutter</a>, a cross-platform framework that allows Android and iOS apps to share the same codebase while also providing native-performance.</p><p>We’ve added many new features since Natrium’s initial release — most notably the ability to redeem paper wallets instantly. We’re excited to announce some big new features that are available today.</p><h2 id=\"multi-accounts-made-simple\">Multi-accounts, Made Simple</h2><p>Probably the most requested feature of our users has been the ability to manage multiple accounts from within Natrium. The biggest challenge we had to overcome when considering this was, how can we accomplish this without cluttering the interface and obstructing the current flow of the interface?</p><p>Today as part of this release, <strong>multiple accounts are now supported in Natrium!</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"image-wrapper\"><img data-sizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_100,c_limit,q_1,f_auto,pg_1/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-multi-accounts.png\" data-srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_300,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-multi-accounts.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_600,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-multi-accounts.png 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_900,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-multi-accounts.png 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_1200,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-multi-accounts.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_1500,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-multi-accounts.png 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_2000,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-multi-accounts.png 2000w\" class=\"kg-image lazyload\" alt=\"Easy to use &amp; familiar multi-account implementation\"></div><figcaption>Easy to use &amp; familiar multi-account implementation</figcaption></figure><p>We expanded the interface to allow for multiple accounts by using an account-switching interface that most people are already familiar with — similar to some of the most popular apps people use such as Twitter, eBay, Telegram, and many more. You can add up to 20 accounts, hide them, and rename them. Switching to a different account takes only one tap, then you’re instantly ready to use it. Push notifications work for all 20 accounts, tapping a notification will open the app and automatically switch to the account the notification is for — making the entire experience as seamless as ever.</p><h2 id=\"system-wide-themes\">System-wide Themes</h2><p>Natrium 2.0 introduces a comprehensive theme system. From clean and professional to wacky and bright, there’s a style for everyone.
