This has numerous benefits including: simple, easy-to-remember account numbers instead of long, complex hex-strings, reducing the “squatting” on account names (as they are stored on-chain), and the ability to trade, sell them (e.g. for vanity purposes, or to sell a name). Unfortunately, the process of getting an account has been confusing and difficult for many users.</li><li>PascalCoin had a lack of wallet options, particularly light wallets. The community wanted an intuitive wallet that would be incredibly quick to setup and use, while still supporting PascalCoin’s numerous and innovative features.</li></ol><h2 id=\"meet-blaise\">Meet Blaise</h2><p>Blaise was developed for PascalCoin by <a href=\"https://appditto.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong><strong>Appditto</strong></strong></a> as a part of PIP (PascalCoin Improvement Proposal) #35C. Solving these unique challenges were fundamental goals of the Blaise project — and we’ve succeeded. Blaise solves both of these challenges — it’s innovative, unique, and easy to use. The account process has never been easier.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/blaise-send-receive-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"With Blaise, you can easily manage all your operations\"><figcaption>With Blaise, you can easily manage all your operations</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"getting-an-account-made-simple\">Getting an Account, Made Simple</h2><p>Blaise introduces an innovative “borrow an account” system. After just a couple of taps, you‘ll be given a “borrowed account.” Simply send some Pascal to it and the account will be permanently transferred to your public key. The only cost is a small 0.25 pascal fee (less than $0.04, equivalent), that will be deducted automatically from the funds you send. The account, once transferred, is yours permanently.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/blaise-first-account.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"With Blaise, getting your first Pascal account is super easy.\"><figcaption>With Blaise, getting your first Pascal account is super easy.</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"send-pascal-however-you-want\">Send Pascal, However You Want</h2><p>Sending Pascal is easier and faster than ever with Blaise. Converting to local currency, scanning a QR code, adding payloads, sending to an on-chain account name, a feature-rich address book. All of these options are bundled into a streamlined, innovative interface.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/blaise-send.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Blaise makes sending Pascal fast &amp; easy with various options\"><figcaption>Blaise makes sending Pascal fast &amp; easy with various options</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"blaise-speaks-multiple-languages\">Blaise Speaks Multiple Languages</h2><p>The entire interface, made to speak your language.

Blaise will alert you when you receive Pascal to any of your accounts through a push notification. Tired of constantly checking your wallet to see if that exchange withdraw has finally been processed? With Blaise, there’s no guesswork and you’ll know exactly when funds hit your account.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/blaise-notifications.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Blaise notifies you when you receive Pascal\"><figcaption>Blaise notifies you when you receive Pascal</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-technology-behind-the-blaise-wallet\">The Technology Behind the Blaise Wallet</h2><p>We developed Blaise Wallet using the latest in mobile application frameworks, <a href=\"https://flutter.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong><strong>Flutter</strong></strong></a>. Flutter applications are developed using the <a href=\"https://dartlang.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong><strong>Dart</strong></strong></a> programming language.</p><p>There’s three primary components that drive the Blaise Wallet:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://github.com/appditto/pascaldart\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong><strong>PascalDart</strong></strong></a> — A 100% dart PascalCoin library, it supports key generation, ecliptic curve cryptography — including ECDH signatures and ECIES encryption, a full JSON-RPC API for interacting with the PascalCoin node, and many other features that are critical to the operation of Blaise.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/appditto/blaise_wallet_flutter\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong><strong>Blaise Flutter Application</strong></strong></a><strong><strong> </strong></strong>— The user-facing application. It includes everything the users see and interact with, it also is responsible for critical functions such as secure key storage. The business logic lives here.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/appditto/blaise_wallet_server\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong><strong>Blaise Server</strong></strong></a> — The server that powers Blaise. It is written in <a href=\"http://python.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Python</a> — using <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">asyncio</a> and <a href=\"https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">AIOHTTP</a> for incredibly high performance and high concurrency. It powers the major “borrow account” feature, it provides a web-socket service so it can push price updates and new transactions to users, it is responsible for sending push notifications using <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Firebase Cloud Messaging</a>, it also enhances server security by restricting access to the PascalCoin node.</li></ol><p>All of these are open source and released under the permissive <a href=\"https://github.com/appditto/blaise_wallet_flutter/blob/master/LICENSE\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">MIT License</a>.</p><h2 id=\"get-blaise-\">Get Blaise!</h2><p>Blaise is completely free and compatible with most Android and iOS devices.</p><p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appditto.blaise\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong><strong>Get it for Android on the Google Play Store</strong></strong></a><strong><strong>!</strong></strong></p><p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blaise-pascal-wallet/id1473011216\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong><strong>Get it for iOS on the App Store</strong></strong></a><strong><strong>!</strong></strong></p><p><a href=\"https://blaisewallet.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong><strong>Visit the Blaise Website!</strong></strong></a></p><p>Users who do not have the Google Play Store available in their region or on their device can get the latest releases from <a href=\"https://github.com/appditto/blaise_wallet_flutter/releases\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong><strong>GitHub</strong></strong></a>.</p><h2 id=\"thanks-for-reading-\">Thanks for reading!</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2020/01/appditto-preview-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Don't forget to follow Appditto on social media\"></figure><p>Appditto Website: <a href=\"http://appditto.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong><strong>appditto.com</strong></strong></a></p><p>Appditto Twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/appditto\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong><strong>@appditto</strong></strong></a></p><p>Appditto Github: <a href=\"http://github.com/appditto\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong><strong>@appditto</strong></strong></a></p><p>Appditto Instagram: <a href=\"http://instagram.com/appditto\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong><strong>@appditto</strong></strong></a></p>","comment_id":"5ddbb1fcfa31649e88349300","feature_image":"https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/blaise-send-receive-2.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2019-11-25T10:50:36.000+00:00","updated_at":"2020-01-31T10:35:09.000+00:00","published_at":"2019-08-20T10:54:00.000+00:00","custom_excerpt":"Blaise is a next-generation wallet for the PascalCoin cryptocurrency.
