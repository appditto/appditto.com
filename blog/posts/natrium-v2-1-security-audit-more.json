Our own definition of Natrium is <strong><strong><em><em>Fast, Robust, &amp; Secure NANO Wallet</em></em></strong></strong>.

Red4Sec conducted a comprehensive security audit and they found that Natrium had <strong><strong><em><em>no critical vulnerabilities</em></em></strong></strong>. They had some recommendations to prevent lower risk vulnerabilities that require a higher skill, depend on certain factors — such as being rooted, or are related to protecting less sensitive information such as your public NANO address. Their recommendations have been implemented into Natrium v2.1.</p><p>Among these include an option to encrypt your seed with a user-provided password. While Natrium currently utilizes the built-in security of the device itself — using the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">iOS KeyChain</a> and the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Android KeyStore</a>. Users can now add an additional layer of security to their wallet by encrypting their seed with a password that is not stored on the device. This is <em><em>optional</em></em>, but it may be beneficial for users who just want to take extra precautions, are using Natrium on a rooted or jailbroken device, or are using Natrium on a device that is not secured by a passcode, pin, or biometrics.</p><p>Some of the other changes related to the audit are less apparent, but they include: a warning when users are using a rooted or jailbroken device, cleaning up information leakage in application logs — for example Natrium logging your public nano_ address in general system logs, using a secure clipboard on iOS — disabling <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209460\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Universal Clipboard</a> and setting an expiration for copying sensitive data.</p><p>We’re thankful to the Nano Foundation for providing us with the opportunity to be audited, and we’re proud that when people install Natrium they can be confident that their seed, private keys, and other sensitive data is <strong><strong><em><em>secure</em></em></strong></strong><em><em>.</em></em></p><h2 id=\"what-else-is-new-in-natrium-2-1\">What Else is New in Natrium 2.1?</h2><p>In addition to the audit-related changes mentioned above, Natrium 2.1 also adds the following new features:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Live Support</strong></strong> — Chat with us in real-time from within the application. We saw a need to provide better support — people have questions, issues and they aren’t always sure where they should go. Now, they can reach us directly from within Natrium and get answers quickly. We hope that this can make the experience of using a non-custodial wallet, such as Natrium, less intimidating and easier for all users.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"image-wrapper\"><img data-sizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_100,c_limit,q_1,f_auto,pg_1/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-live-support.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_300,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-live-support.gif 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_600,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-live-support.gif 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_900,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-live-support.gif 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_1200,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-live-support.gif 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_1500,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-live-support.gif 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/appditto/image/fetch/w_2000,c_limit,q_80,f_auto/https://ghost.appditto.com/content/images/2019/11/natrium-live-support.gif 2000w\" class=\"kg-image lazyload\" alt=\"Natrium now has live support!\"></div><figcaption>Natrium now has live support!</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>QR Scanner Shortcut</strong> — Often times users are sending NANO using QR codes.

Not just in terms of our skillsets, but also about how people commonly interact with Natrium and cryptocurrency wallets in general. We’ve also learned a lot of new things about <a href=\"http://flutter.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong><strong>Flutter</strong></strong></a>, and Flutter has evolved since we’ve initially developed Natrium. We have developed a comprehensive plan to rebuild Natrium using all of the new knowledge we have acquired in the codebase and also in the interface. There’s a lot of things we know we can do better, so we’re going to.</p><p>In comes <strong><strong>Natrium 3</strong></strong>, a light re-design and comprehensive rewrite of a large part of Natrium’s code base. Natrium 3 is combination of all of the things we have learned to date — about how people interact with the app and also simply things we can do better in the codebase. Natrium 3 is our next milestone — we want to make Natrium leaner, faster, more efficient, and easier-to-use than ever before. We’re excited to share our progress on Natrium 3 with you in the coming weeks.</p><h2 id=\"support-natrium-development\">Support Natrium Development</h2><p>Natrium is open source and released under the MIT license — it is completely <em><em>free</em></em>.
